Instead, companies now offer a shared desk model. This means that employees flexibly share workstations. Often, you can reserve your desired workstation in advance. This workplace booking function has attracted me for some time. I find the possibility to create a Custom Reactive Form in Angular, which also includes an office plan, particularly interesting. In the Custom Angular Reactive SVG Form there is the possibility to select a workstation from the office plan and to mark it with a color. As soon as a workstation has been chosen, the form will be validated and the desk will be bookable. In the following the implementation is explained step by step.",

The screen doesn't need to know the details of the movie it's playing - all it does is show whatever content is projected onto it.\n\nThis is a similar idea to how content projection works in web development! Today, we'll go over what content projection looks like and how you can use it to make components that are reusable and less tied to the data they display.\n\nWe'll be using Angular for these examples, but any framework you'd like to use likely has a way to do this as well!",
